# advent-of-code-golang
Solving Advent of Code problems and practicing Go programming.

Solutions are in [solutions](/solutions/), each day is its own package `y{yyyy}d{dd}`. Building the project creates cli app.

Usage:
```bash
go build . solve 2024 1 --file data/2024/01/input.txt
```

Older solutions are in [stand-alone-solutions](/stand-alone-solutions/) where each day is its own main package.
